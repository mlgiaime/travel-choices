11/9/15-- Beginning of project planning. All images acquired, but not edited for formatting. User stories worked on. HTML page is a general skeleton. JS is happening, but not yet functional.
11/10/15-- Borrowed code examples from Emily Aviva's gemstone project from a previous course. Most of the JS at this point was due to a lot of help from Chris Lee. I have now added most of the necessary JS and HTML. Images still need to be formatted and a vote counter needs to be put in effect.
11/11/15-- Started most of the code over due to receiving too much help with it the first time and therefore I did not feel as if I had learned enough to move on to another assignment. After working through this on my own with limited help, it became much easier to understand and I am now happy with my assignment submission. I approached the problem domain with a basic plan and page sketch and built it out from there. The hardest part was starting. Even with a plan mapped out, it was hard to find a good starting point. In the end, I worked on what I knew I could complete on my own first to get them out of the way -- HTML, constructor function, and some CSS.
