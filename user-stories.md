The users/visitors to this site are people who like to plan out their future travels and are looking for potential inspiration. This page is not a comprehensive list of popular travel destinations, but it is a general guide to point you in the right direction for where you would like to go. Example: If the user gets a photo of Big Ben in London and then remembers that they had wanted to travel to the UK at some point, then the site has worked!
